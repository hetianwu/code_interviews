# code_interviews


This repository has all solutions of the  problems from tech interviews that I solved by myself. Most of them are my original solutions.  The files with filenames starting with "LC" are problems taken from LeetCode. 
All source codes posted in this repository have been tested and passed the test cases on the online judge systems.(Not neceeasarily the most effiecient one)
